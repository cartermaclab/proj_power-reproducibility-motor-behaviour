The Eriksen flanker task was implemented during the physical task to measure inhibition performance (Eriksen & Eriksen, 1974). We therefore expected to observe a mediation effect of HD-tDCS on endurance times by the executive function of inhibition. This mediation would experimentally specify the role of CPF in the maintenance of physical effort through an inhibitory control over painful physical sensations.",unknown,unknown,gpower

This can provide information about how PD interferes in the performance of outdoor tasks as well as a basis for formulating strategies to reduce the risk of road traffic accidents.
