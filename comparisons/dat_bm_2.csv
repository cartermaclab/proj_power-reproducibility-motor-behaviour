Further, we anticipate that when adopting an external focus of attention the improvement in APAs is accompanied with improved performance in behavioral and kinematic measures.

That is, we expected that participants would judge that they could walk farther along the athwart path than along the fore-aft path, and that judgments would accurately reflect actual performance. On the other day (which happened to be the first day of testing), the relative magnitudes of pitch and roll were reversed, such that pitch > roll. Under this condition, we predicted that participants would judge that they could walk further along the fore-aft path than on the athwart path, and that judgments would accurately reflect actual performance. Under both patterns of ship motion (i.e., roll > pitch, and pitch > roll), we predicted that mean judgments of walking ability would differ across walking directions (i.e., walking fore-aft vs. walking athwartship). Our central prediction was that the nature of this difference would itself differ across ship motion conditions, such that the Ship Motion × Walking Direction interaction would be statistically significant. With respect to the accuracy of judgments, our prediction was that any changes in judgment accuracy would be independent of our predicted effects in mean judgments, and independent of any changes in the overall magnitude of ship motion.",unknown,unknown,not_app,
